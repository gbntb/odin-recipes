    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Branzino, also known as European sea bass, is a delicious white fish with a mild flavor. I like to cook them whole, stuffed with lemon wedges, fresh oregano, and rosemary before roasting them for an easy dinner full of Greek flavor.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>
        <li>1 red onion, chopped</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 whole Branzino (sea bass) fish, cleaned</li>
        <li>4 lemon wedges, divided</li>
        <li>2 sprigs fresh rosemary</li>
        <li>½ cup white wine</li>
        <li>¼ cup lemon juice</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon fresh oregano leaves</li>
        <li>¼ cup chopped Italian flat-leaf parsley</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Drizzle 1 tablespoon olive oil into a large baking pan; add red onion and season with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Place 2 whole branzino fish into the baking pan. Stuff each cavity with 1 lemon wedge, 1 rosemary sprig, and some of the red onion in the pan. Pour white wine and lemon juice over fish and sprinkle with oregano. Drizzle remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil over fish.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until fish is opaque and flakes easily with a fork, about 25 minutes.</li>
        <li>Gently slide a spatula between the bones to separate fish; remove all the bones. Serve fish on a platter; garnish with parsley and 2 lemon wedges.</li>
    </ol>
